# Implementation-of-Llama-Agents
llama-agents is an async-first framework for building, iterating, and productionizing multi-agent systems, including multi-agent communication, distributed tool execution, human-in-the-loop, and more!

## Basic Implementation of Llama Agents
The flow of Implementation will be like this -
1. Create Tool
2. Create Agent
3. Create Components
4. Llama kickoff

  
## How to create an AI agent?
### Creating an AI agent involves several steps:
1. Define the Agent's Purpose: Determine the tasks or problems the agent will handle.
2. Select Tools and Models: Choose appropriate algorithms, machine learning models, and tools.
3. Develop the Agent: Write the code to implement the agent’s logic and integrate the tools and models.
4. Train the Agent: Use relevant data to train the agent, improving its performance over time.
5. Test and Deploy: Test the agent thoroughly and deploy it in the desired environment.
Frameworks like `llama-agents` can be used to streamline the process of building and deploying AI agents.

The quickest way to get started is by using an existing agent (or agents) and integrating them into a launcher.
Below is a simple example using two agents from llama-index.
First, let's set up the agents and initial components for our llama-agents system:

Setting OPEN_API_KEY in WINDOWS - 
Set OPENAI_API_KEY = ”sk-XXXXXXX”

For Linux and macOS - 
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-XXXXX"
